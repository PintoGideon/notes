The Ventricular system is a set of four interconnected cavities known as cerebral ventricles in the brain.

Being able to segment the cerebral ventricles to determine the quantity of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) within the ventricles has widespread applicability in many neurological conditions. Although this segmentation would seem to be a relatively straightforward task, such is not the case requiring manual tracing of the ventricular outline on multiple image slices. This process is tedious, time-consuming, operator dependent and rarely done except for research purposes. 

To establish new cross-sectional reference values
for the size of the lateral ventricles in a large cohort
of neonates between 24 and 42 weeks GA.

VI - Ventricular Index
Defined as the distance between the falx and the lateral wall of the anterior horn
GA - Gestational Age
TEA - Term Equivalent Age
AHW - Anterior Horn Width
Anterior horn width defined as the diagnol width of the
anterior horn 
TOD- Thalamo occipital distance

Background Info:


Posthemorrhagic ventricular dilation affects approximately 75% of preterm infants following a severe germinal matrix-intraventricular
hemorrhage and represents a potential threat to the developing neonatal brain ( 1 ). In infants with progressive ventricular dilation, drainage of cerebrospinal fluid has been shown to improve cerebral hemodynamics and oxygenation and may prevent further brain injury ( 2,3 ). To diagnose posthemorrhagic ventricular dilation and evaluate the need for intervention, measurement of ventricular size by means of cranial ultrasonography (US) has been
shown to be superior to measurement of head circumference or assessment of clinical symptoms of raised intracranial pressure.
